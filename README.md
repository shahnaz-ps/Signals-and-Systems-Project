# Signals-and-Systems-Project : Noise Reduction in Images Using MATLAB (P8)

## Overview
This project explores different types of image noise and implements various filters in MATLAB to reduce these noises. Noise types include impulse, additive, salt-and-pepper, shot, speckle, uniform additive, Gaussian, Poisson, and periodic noise. The primary objective is to apply suitable noise reduction techniques and compare their effectiveness.

## Files
- `Project.m`: MATLAB code implementing noise generation and filtering techniques.
- `ProjectReport.pdf`: Detailed report explaining the noise types, generation methods, and filter implementations.

## Project Structure
1. **Noise Generation**: Introduces various noise types into sample images, using predefined parameters (e.g., intensity and frequency).
2. **Filtering Techniques**: Applies filters to remove noise:
   - **Linear Smoothing Filter**
   - **Wiener Filter**
   - **Median Filter**
   - **Gaussian Filter**
   
3. **Results**: Each noise type's filtered image is analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of each filter type.

## Usage
1. Run the MATLAB file `Project.m` to generate noisy images and apply filters.
2. Refer to `ProjectReport.pdf` for in-depth explanations and visual results.

## Notes
This project is part of a Signal & Systems course focused on practical applications of noise reduction techniques. Filters are chosen based on the specific noise characteristics to maximize clarity in the final images.
